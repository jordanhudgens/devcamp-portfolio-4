    <p>With over a decade of development experience in a number of industries I realized that the typical product creation process between clients and developers was flawed. All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user </p>

    <p>For this reason I decided to utilize a completely different development pattern that focuses on highly focused communication and transparent design patterns. When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications, I give daily updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product,delivered on time, and on budget.</p>

    <!--I am currently going through a bootcamp to become a web developer, my goal is to become the best I can can be at what I do. I am constantly reading up and trying to better myself in the career I have chosen to pursue. I do believe hardwork and communication are key to becomming a strong developer.-->
